# MensaViva
Fullpage OpenStreetMap with trendy (hoodmap style) user (no login required) restaurant reviews.
Restaurants appear as grey dots when no one has reviewed them yet.
Free API is used to get basic restaurant data that is saved to a database and updated after it becomes stale (1 week).
Scalable.
